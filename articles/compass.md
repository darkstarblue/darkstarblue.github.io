# The Resilience Compass  
*Returning to yourself when the plan breaks*

I'm writing this from a hotel terrace in Gran Canaria, halfway through a much-needed holiday. The sea is wide and quiet. My breakfast has settled. My legs are bouncing gently to Hall & Oates on Spotify. It’s the first time in months I’ve had the space to pause — not just to rest, but to think clearly.

Just over a year ago, I published a short guide to weight loss and better sleep. It was a reflection on the year before — a period when I had been out of work, unusually free to focus on my health. The post was prompted by family members who’d asked how I’d lost so much weight while, to them, still eating like a “normal person.” The answer, I realised, wasn’t found in calorie maths or heroic willpower. It was rhythm, rest, and small acts of attention. I called the piece [*A Relaxed Guide to Weight Loss and a Better Night’s Sleep*](https://medium.com/p/78a70ae95934), and for a time, it captured where I was: steady, intentional, in sync with myself.

But life, as it does, shifted. I returned to work in mid-2023 — juggling a full-time role and a contract. The pressure mounted. The contract went first, then the job itself. I picked the contract back up, grateful for the flexibility — but that same flexibility let my ASD tendencies of perfectionism and hyperfocus run unchecked. The work was absorbing, but balance unraveled. My ADHD medication reached maximum dose by mid-2024, and a few unmedicated weeks in late 2023 were enough to trigger a relapse of my binge eating disorder. I didn’t have the cognitive or temporal budget to claw my way back to the routines I’d once relied on.

Meanwhile, my body was sending signals I didn’t fully register until later: creeping hypothyroidism, rising blood sugar — borderline prediabetic. Not a crisis. But not a coincidence either.

Still, none of that was the moment I knew I had to re-centre. That came more quietly.

Someone I know recently started following *The Fast Diet*. I haven’t read it myself, but I’m familiar with the ideas — both from long-standing interest and our recent conversations. The book promotes intermittent fasting through sharply reduced caloric intake on two non-consecutive days each week: 500 kcal for women, 600 for men. It’s not without its merits — and I suspect it does touch on broader health behaviours too.

But the way it’s been interpreted — as a shortcut to weight loss rather than a catalyst for habit change — felt off. It highlighted, for me, a common issue with this kind of literature: when the *headline* is the weight loss tactic, it’s easy to miss the surrounding nuance. To habitualise restriction instead of reflection. To focus on compensating for choices rather than transforming them.

That disconnect prompted me to reflect — not just on the book, but on my own recent drift from the habits I once wrote about with such confidence.

And that raised the better question:

**If you can’t follow the plan anymore, what helps you come back to yourself?**

This post is my answer.

That question — *how to return when the plan no longer fits* — didn’t come with an answer at first. Just a pause. And now, this pause — here in the sunlight, noise-cancelling headphones snugly in place (because, yes, autism), legs bouncing in time to *Out of Touch* by Hall & Oates, a hotel-issue mocha cooling beside me — is when the real answer starts to take shape.

(Well — not a mocha. A hot chocolate. I don’t drink coffee — stimulant meds and all. But I still think in “mocha,” which probably tells you everything you need to know about the permanent coffee-mind my prescription gives me.)

The leg bouncing? That’s not just nerves. It’s a habit I wrote about in my original post — *any movement after a meal counts*. Turns out, it still does.

So no, this isn’t a restart. And it’s not a new plan.

It’s something quieter. A set of **preferences**. Small internal shifts that help me tilt back toward balance. Not rules. Not rituals.

Just a compass I can reach for when I need to return.

## The Resilience Compass  
*When routines collapse, when energy’s uneven, when the plan doesn't stick — this is the compass I reach for.*

These are not rules. They’re **preferences**: small tilts in direction that help re-orient without needing to start over. You don’t have to do all of them. You don’t have to do any of them perfectly. They're here to give shape to your return.

### Prefer *self-awareness* over *self-control*
- Instead of forcing yourself not to snack, ask: *what’s this urge responding to?*
- Noticing “I feel unstructured today” is more useful than “I shouldn’t be doing this.”

### Prefer *nourishment* over *restriction*
- A bowl of oats with peanut butter and fruit will calm your system better than skipping breakfast to “undo” a binge.
- A full, balanced dinner after a chaotic day stabilises more than a punished appetite ever could.

### Prefer *course correction* over *starting over*
- Return with the next meal or moment — not a Monday, not a reset plan.
- 10 minutes of walking today is better than aiming for 10,000 and doing none.

### Prefer *context-sensitive rhythm* over *rigid structure*
- Eat when your body has energy to process food — even if it’s outside “ideal” windows.
- Don’t cling to fasting windows if your thyroid, ADHD meds, or sleep rhythm are in flux.

### Prefer *next-best action* over *ideal behaviour*
- Didn’t prep lunch? Grab the most balanced option available — not the lowest-calorie.
- Can’t exercise? Stretch at your desk. Open a window. Reconnect with your body, gently.

### Prefer *curiosity* over *judgement*
- “What led to this choice?” is a doorway. “Why am I like this?” is a trap.
- You’re not failing. You’re *collecting data*.

These preferences help me navigate the days when I fall short, not with blame, but with a sense of return. They help me orient toward care — not control. Toward process — not performance.

This is what I reach for now. Not a reset. A return.

## Returning Gently

The truth is, I don’t know exactly what comes next. I’m still on holiday. I’m still somewhere between states — not quite off, not quite on. And like most all-inclusive setups, the roads to healthy habits here are paved with poor decisions: buffet breakfasts, bottomless bread baskets, the quiet chaos of free pudding. My body isn’t sure what to make of it — and to be honest, neither am I.

But I do know this: I won’t be starting over.

I’ll be returning.

I’ve hovered around 90kg for a while now — give or take a kilo — and while it’s not a number I fixate on, it’s also not nothing. The original guide got me all the way down to 75kg — dramatically, and without a single calorie cut. But it required constant vigilance, the kind of quiet, daily sharpness that’s hard to sustain through stress, diagnosis, and shifting priorities. It worked, until it didn’t (*the title track of my imaginary album about life, ADHD, ASD and a comedy of errors*). And while parts of it still echo through my days, I haven’t always had the bandwidth to live it — or even to remember what helped.

So I’m not chasing the version of me who wrote that post. I respect him. I admire his clarity. But I’ve lived a lot since then — through stress, diagnosis, medication shifts, and relapse. That version of me knew how to tune in. This version knows how to tune back in after static.

This post — this compass — isn’t about performance or redemption. It’s just a quiet turning point. A line in the sand.

From here on, I’m finding my new normal — not just in weight or food, but in how I work, how I rest, and how I return to myself when things go sideways.

If you're in that space too — not at the beginning, not at the end, just somewhere in-between — I hope this compass gives you a direction, not a demand. And if nothing else, I hope you find your own version of this moment: warm sun, soft background noise, a drink you forgot you ordered, and just enough space to hear yourself again.
